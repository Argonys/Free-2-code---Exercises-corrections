## Hola learners of BeCode!
As you know I am currently working on multiple projects, one of which you might have heard about, "The prison project".   
A project where we train inmates the basics of web development! If they like the program, and succeeded the course, they have the possibility to join a BeCode training when they return to our society.
---
We are sort of in need of your help, we have created some basic HTML and CSS exercises, but also need to provide the solutions to these exercises.
Now if one person did this, it could get boring very easily. But if a group of people did this. It could be done in no time!

## You are up for this task? 

Great! Inside these 2 folders, you will find more folders, each of these folders are chapters.   
Inside of each chapter, there are some exercises. These exercises need to get a correction.html file.

Your job is to create this file, and complete the exercise in the best possible way.

## before you start

Come to me and I will assign you as a collaborator to this repository.   
After this fork the repository. When you own a forked version, you come to me and ask me for an exercise, I will assign you to one.   
When you are done, make a pull request. I will quickly check the result and accept.   
If you feel up for a new exercise, we repeat this process. Except from forking the repository of course!
