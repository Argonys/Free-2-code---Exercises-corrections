## Hola learners of BeCode!   

As you know I am working on multiple projects, one of which you might have heard about, "The prison project".     
A project where we train inmates on the basics of web development! If they like the program, and succeeded the course, they have the possibility to join a BeCode training when they return to our society.  

---

We need your help; we have created some basic HTML and CSS exercises, but also need to provide the solutions to these exercises.   
Now if one person did this, it could become a boring task. But if a group of people did this. We could do it in no time!   

## Are you up for this task? 

Great! Inside these 2 folders, you will find the exercise folders, inside of this folder there are sub-chapters.   
Inside of each chapter, there are more folders which contain the exercises. These exercises need to get a correction.html or/and correction.css file.   

Your job is to create these file and complete the exercise in the best practice that you know.   

## before you start

Come to me and I will assign you as a collaborator to this repository.   
After this fork the repository. When you own a forked version, you come to me and ask me for an exercise, I will assign you to one.    
When you finished, make a pull request. I will quickly check the result and accept.   
If you feel up for another exercise, we repeat this process. Except from forking the repository!
